To build the XPI installer, enter this directory and run build.sh:

  ./build.sh

In Windows, one can use for example [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) for building.
Just make sure that you also have the zip package installed and the script
uses unix style line ending (for the usage of the backslash as line continuation).

This will create a file scaffold.xpi, which you can open in Firefox
to install.
