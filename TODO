Relatively important
 - Provide guidance on translator options
 - Links to documentation (why not?)
 - show matching translators for given import text
 - tools for writing export and search translators

Not very important
 - Automatic gisting? Or maybe something like Frank's style test generator? 
	See: http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/
	Not sure how we'd handle that-- no need to gist existing translators,
	so only useful for new code
 - Type-to-find in translator load window
